========================================
  Inventor Batch Export Tool - Usage Guide
========================================

REQUIREMENTS
- Windows 10 or 11
- Autodesk Inventor 2026 (must be running before you start the tool)

GETTING STARTED
1. Unzip the folder to any location on your computer (e.g. Desktop or Documents).
2. Open the folder and double-click "InventorExportTool.exe" to start.
3. If Windows SmartScreen warns you, click "More info" then "Run anyway".
   The tool is safe -- it only talks to Inventor on your computer.

HOW TO USE
1. Open your assembly in Inventor first.
2. Launch InventorExportTool.exe.
3. Choose an output folder where exported files will be saved.
4. Select which formats to export:
   - STEP (.step) -- 3D model file for other CAD programs
   - DWG (.dwg) -- 2D drawing file (requires matching .idw drawing files)
   - PDF (.pdf) -- printable drawing (requires matching .idw drawing files)
5. Select which components to include:
   - Parts (IPT) -- individual parts
   - Sub-assemblies (IAM) -- nested assemblies
   - Top-level assembly -- the main assembly itself
   - Suppressed components -- parts that are hidden/suppressed in the assembly
6. Click "Scan Assembly" to preview what will be exported.
7. Review the log area -- it shows every file that will be created.
8. Click "Run Export" to start exporting.
9. Wait for the progress bar to finish. Each file shows OK or FAILED in the log.

EXPORT SETTINGS (ADVANCED)
Click the "Settings..." button to configure advanced options for each format:
- STEP tab: Choose AP 203 or AP 214 protocol, set author/organization info
- PDF tab: Set resolution (DPI), color options, which sheets to export
- DWG tab: Point to a custom .ini settings file from Inventor

Your settings are saved automatically and remembered next time you open the tool.

VIEWING THE LOG
After an export finishes, click the "Open Log" button. This opens the log file
in Notepad so you can review results, see any errors, and save or print it.

Log files are saved in your output folder as "export_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt".

CONFIGURATION FILE
The tool creates a "config.json" file next to the .exe. This stores your
settings between sessions. You do NOT need to edit this file -- use the
checkboxes and Settings dialog in the tool instead.

If something goes wrong, you can delete config.json and the tool will
reset to default settings on next launch.

DWG/PDF EXPORT NOTES
- DWG and PDF export require an .idw drawing file with the same name as
  the part or assembly, in the same folder.
  Example: If you have "Bracket.ipt", there must be a "Bracket.idw" nearby.
- If no .idw file is found, that component is skipped for DWG/PDF export.

TROUBLESHOOTING
- "Cannot connect to Inventor" -- Make sure Inventor is running and an
  assembly is open before you launch the tool.
- Export fails for a file -- Check that the file is not open in another
  program and not checked out by someone else in Vault.
- Tool does not start -- Make sure you extracted ALL files from the zip.
  Do not move just the .exe out of the folder.
- Windows blocks the program -- Right-click the .exe, choose Properties,
  and check "Unblock" at the bottom, then click OK.

UPDATES
When you receive a new version, simply replace the entire folder with
the new one. Your config.json can be copied over if you want to keep
your settings.
