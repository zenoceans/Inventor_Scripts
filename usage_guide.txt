  Zabra-Cadabra - Usage Guide
========================================

Zabra-Cadabra is a multi-tool desktop application for Autodesk Inventor 2026.
It contains multiple tools organized as tabs in a single window.

Current tools:
  - Inventor Export: Batch-export STEP, DWG, PDF from assemblies
  - STEP Simplify:   Import STEP files, simplify, save as .ipt

REQUIREMENTS
- Windows 10 or 11
- Autodesk Inventor 2026 (must be running before you start the tool)

GETTING STARTED
1. Unzip the folder to any location on your computer (e.g. Desktop or Documents).
2. Open the folder and double-click "ZabraCadabra.exe" to start.
3. If Windows SmartScreen warns you, click "More info" then "Run anyway".
   The tool is safe -- it only talks to Inventor on your computer.

========================================
  TAB 1: INVENTOR EXPORT
========================================

HOW TO USE
1. Open your assembly in Inventor first.
2. Launch ZabraCadabra.exe and go to the "Inventor Export" tab.
3. Choose an output folder where exported files will be saved.
4. Select which formats to export:
   - STEP (.step) -- 3D model file for other CAD programs
   - DWG (.dwg) -- 2D drawing file (requires matching .idw drawing files)
   - PDF (.pdf) -- printable drawing (requires matching .idw drawing files)
5. Select which components to include:
   - Parts (IPT) -- individual parts
   - Sub-assemblies (IAM) -- nested assemblies
   - Top-level assembly -- the main assembly itself
   - Suppressed components -- parts that are hidden/suppressed in the assembly
6. Click "Scan Assembly" to preview what will be exported.
7. Review the log area -- it shows every file that will be created.
8. Click "Run Export" to start exporting.
9. Wait for the progress bar to finish. Each file shows OK or FAILED in the log.

EXPORT SETTINGS (ADVANCED)
Click the "Settings..." button to configure advanced options for each format:
- STEP tab: Choose AP 203 or AP 214 protocol, set author/organization info
- PDF tab: Set resolution (DPI), color options, which sheets to export
- DWG: Uses Inventor's native SaveAs -- no advanced settings needed

Your settings are saved automatically and remembered next time you open the tool.

DWG/PDF EXPORT NOTES
- DWG and PDF export require an .idw drawing file with the same name as
  the part or assembly, in the same folder.
  Example: If you have "Bracket.ipt", there must be a "Bracket.idw" nearby.
- If no .idw file is found, that component is skipped for DWG/PDF export.
- DWG export uses Inventor's native format conversion (not a translator).
- PDF font substitution warnings are suppressed automatically so they
  don't interrupt the batch flow.

========================================
  TAB 2: STEP SIMPLIFY
========================================

HOW TO USE
1. Make sure Inventor is running.
2. Launch ZabraCadabra.exe and go to the "STEP Simplify" tab.
3. Click "Add Files..." and select one or more STEP files (.stp or .step).
4. The files appear in the table with columns:
   - STEP File: the source file path
   - Output Name: the name for the simplified .ipt (editable -- double-click to change)
   - Output Folder: where the .ipt will be saved
5. To change the output folder, select rows and click "Set Output Folder...".
   If no rows are selected, it applies to all rows.
6. (Optional) To insert simplified parts into an assembly:
   - Check "Insert simplified .ipt into target assembly"
   - Browse to your target .iam assembly file
7. Click "Run Simplify" to start processing.
8. Each STEP file is imported into Inventor, simplified, and saved as .ipt.
   Progress and results are shown in the log area below.
9. Click "Cancel" at any time to stop after the current file finishes.

========================================
  GENERAL
========================================

VIEWING THE LOG
After an export or simplify run finishes, click the "Open Log" button.
This opens the log file in Notepad so you can review results, see any
errors, and save or print it.

CONFIGURATION FILES
The tool creates configuration files next to the .exe:
- config.json -- Inventor Export settings
- simplify_config.json -- STEP Simplify settings

You do NOT need to edit these files -- use the GUI controls instead.
If something goes wrong, you can delete these files and the tool will
reset to default settings on next launch.

TROUBLESHOOTING
- "Cannot connect to Inventor" -- Make sure Inventor is running and a
  document is open before you launch the tool.
- Export fails for a file -- Check that the file is not open in another
  program and not checked out by someone else in Vault.
- Tool does not start -- Make sure you extracted ALL files from the zip.
  Do not move just the .exe out of the folder.
- Windows blocks the program -- Right-click the .exe, choose Properties,
  and check "Unblock" at the bottom, then click OK.

UPDATES
When you receive a new version, simply replace the entire folder with
the new one. Your config files (config.json, simplify_config.json) can
be copied over if you want to keep your settings.
